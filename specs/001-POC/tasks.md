# Tasks: SawtFeel - Arabic Audio Emotion Analysis

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-lets-create-our/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/
**Test Video**: `videos/aggression.mp4` - Used for all video processing and emotion analysis testing

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting, video processing libraries
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests, video quality tests, translation tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands, video processors, translation engines
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging, video streaming pipelines
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs, video analysis validation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

- T027-T030 blocks T031-T034 (models before services)
- T031-T034 blocks T035-T038 (services before API)
- T035-T038 blocks T049-T053 (API before integration)
- T039-T048 blocks T054-T057 (components before frontend integration)
- Implementation before polish (T062-T073)

## Parallel Example
```
# Launch T011-T017 together (Contract Tests):
Task: "Contract test POST /api/upload in tests/contract/test_upload.py"
Task: "Contract test GET /api/upload/{id}/status in tests/contract/test_upload.py"
Task: "Contract test GET /api/processing/{id}/transcript in tests/contract/test_processing.py"
Task: "Contract test GET /api/processing/{id}/emotions in tests/contract/test_processing.py"
Task: "Contract test GET /api/processing/{id}/audio-url in tests/contract/test_processing.py"
Task: "Contract test WebSocket /ws/processing/{id} in tests/contract/test_websocket.py"
Task: "Contract test WebSocket /ws/playback/{id} in tests/contract/test_websocket.py"

# Launch T027-T030 together (Backend Models):
Task: "AudioFile model in backend/src/models/audio_file.py"
Task: "Transcript model in backend/src/models/transcript.py"
Task: "EmotionAnalysis model in backend/src/models/emotion_analysis.py"
Task: "PlaybackState model in backend/src/models/playback_state.py"
```

## Test Video Usage
**videos/aggression.mp4** will be used throughout testing for:
- Video format validation (MP4 support)
- Audio extraction testing
- Arabic speech transcription testing
- Emotion analysis accuracy testing
- Real-time processing performance testing
- Mobile responsiveness testing
- End-to-end workflow validation

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task
- Use videos/aggression.mp4 for all video-related testing
- Ensure mobile responsiveness with touch controls
- Maintain dark/light theme support throughout

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - Each contract file → contract test task [P]
   - Each endpoint → implementation task
   
2. **From Data Model**:
   - Each entity → model creation task [P]
   - Relationships → service layer tasks
   
3. **From User Stories**:
   - Each story → integration test [P]
   - Quickstart scenarios → validation tasks

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Models → Services → Endpoints → Polish
   - Dependencies block parallel execution

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked by main() before returning*

- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests
- [x] All entities have model tasks
- [x] All tests come before implementation
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Test video (videos/aggression.mp4) integrated throughout testing
