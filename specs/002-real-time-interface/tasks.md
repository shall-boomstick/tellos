# Tasks: Real-Time Video Translation and Emotion Analysis Interface

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-real-time-interface/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md
**Feature**: Single-page interface with real-time video playback, translation, and emotion analysis

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load spec.md for user scenarios and requirements
   → Extract: functional requirements, acceptance criteria
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project dependencies, video processing libraries, WebSocket support
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests, real-time synchronization tests
   → Core: models, services, WebSocket endpoints, video streaming
   → Integration: real-time processing, frontend components, synchronization
   → Polish: performance optimization, accessibility, error handling
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts
- Focus on real-time synchronization and WebSocket communication
- Ensure video playback is smooth and responsive

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Spec**:
   - Each functional requirement → implementation task
   - Each user scenario → integration test [P]
   
2. **From Plan**:
   - Each phase → task group
   - Each service → implementation task [P]
   - Each component → implementation task [P]
   
3. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Models → Services → Endpoints → Components → Integration → Polish
   - Dependencies block parallel execution

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked by main() before returning*

- [ ] All functional requirements have corresponding tasks
- [ ] All user scenarios have integration tests
- [ ] All tests come before implementation
- [ ] Parallel tasks truly independent
- [ ] Each task specifies exact file path
- [ ] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [ ] Real-time synchronization properly addressed
- [ ] WebSocket communication properly planned
