# Feature Specification: Real-Time Video Translation and Emotion Analysis Interface

**Feature Branch**: `002-real-time-interface`  
**Created**: 2025-09-30  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "We want to change how our GUI interface works. We want a single GUI page that allows us to upload a file. We then want to be able to watch that video and see real time translation from the native language to english text Scrolling in a box next to it. Also while we are doing realtime translation we should be doing real time analysis of the emotion in the audio and show that in real time a a emotional sliding scale"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user wants to upload a video file containing speech in their native language and watch it while simultaneously seeing real-time English translation and emotion analysis. The interface should provide a seamless experience where the video plays alongside live translation text and emotional indicators that update as the video progresses.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is on the main interface page, **When** they upload a video file, **Then** the system should process the file and display the video player with translation and emotion analysis panels
2. **Given** a video is playing, **When** the user watches the video, **Then** they should see English translation text scrolling in real-time next to the video
3. **Given** a video is playing, **When** the audio contains speech, **Then** the emotion analysis scale should update in real-time showing current emotional state
4. **Given** a video is playing, **When** the user seeks to a different time position, **Then** both translation and emotion analysis should update to match the new position
5. **Given** a video is playing, **When** the user pauses the video, **Then** the translation and emotion analysis should pause at the current position
6. **Given** a video is playing, **When** the user resumes playback, **Then** the translation and emotion analysis should resume from the current position

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the video contains no speech or unclear audio?
- How does the system handle videos with multiple speakers or overlapping speech?
- What happens when the translation service is temporarily unavailable?
- How does the system handle very long videos or videos with poor audio quality?
- What happens when the user uploads an unsupported file format?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a single-page interface for video upload and playback
- **FR-002**: System MUST support video file upload with validation for supported formats
- **FR-003**: System MUST display uploaded video in a video player component
- **FR-004**: System MUST show real-time English translation text in a scrollable text box next to the video
- **FR-005**: System MUST display real-time emotion analysis as a sliding scale indicator
- **FR-006**: System MUST synchronize translation text with video playback timeline
- **FR-007**: System MUST synchronize emotion analysis with video playback timeline
- **FR-008**: System MUST update translation text in real-time as video plays
- **FR-009**: System MUST update emotion analysis in real-time as video plays
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle video seeking (jump to specific time) and update both translation and emotion analysis accordingly
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle video pause/resume and pause/resume both translation and emotion analysis accordingly
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide visual feedback during video processing and analysis
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle errors gracefully when translation or emotion analysis fails
- **FR-014**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: video format support - which specific formats should be supported?]
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: emotion scale details - what emotions should be tracked and how should the scale be displayed?]
- **FR-016**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: translation language support - should this work for any language or specific languages?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Video File**: Represents the uploaded video content with metadata including duration, format, and processing status
- **Translation Segment**: Represents a portion of translated text with timing information and confidence scores
- **Emotion Analysis**: Represents emotional state data with timestamp, emotion type, and intensity level
- **Playback State**: Represents current video position, play/pause status, and synchronization data for translation and emotion analysis
