# Feature Specification: SawtFeel - Arabic Audio Emotion Analysis

**Feature Branch**: `001-lets-create-our`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "lets create our specs using @spec.md by following the @spec-template.md"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user wants to understand the emotional content of Arabic speech by uploading an audio or video file and seeing a real-time visualization of the speaker's emotional state synchronized with the audio playback and transcript.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has an Arabic audio/video file, **When** they upload it to SawtFeel, **Then** the system processes the file and displays an audio player with emotion gauge and transcript
2. **Given** the audio is playing, **When** the user watches the emotion gauge, **Then** it updates in real-time to show the current emotional state
3. **Given** the audio is playing, **When** the user looks at the transcript, **Then** the currently spoken words are highlighted in sync with playback
4. **Given** the user scrubs to a different time in the audio, **When** they release the scrubber, **Then** both the emotion gauge and transcript highlighting update to the correct position
5. **Given** a video file is uploaded, **When** the system processes it, **Then** the audio is automatically extracted and analyzed

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the uploaded file contains no speech or is corrupted?
- How does the system handle files longer than 2 minutes?
- What happens when the Arabic speech is unclear or contains multiple speakers?
- How does the system handle files with background noise or music?
- What happens when the emotion analysis fails or returns low confidence?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept file uploads in MP3, WAV, and MP4 formats
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically extract audio from video files
- **FR-003**: System MUST transcribe Arabic speech with timestamps
- **FR-004**: System MUST analyze transcribed text for emotional content
- **FR-005**: System MUST analyze audio tone for vocal emotion
- **FR-006**: System MUST combine textual and tonal emotion analysis into unified emotional state
- **FR-007**: System MUST display an audio player with play, pause, and scrub controls
- **FR-008**: System MUST show a real-time emotion gauge displaying primary emotions (Anger, Sadness, Joy, Neutral)
- **FR-009**: System MUST display Arabic transcript with current words highlighted during playback
- **FR-010**: System MUST synchronize emotion gauge and transcript highlighting with audio playback
- **FR-011**: System MUST update visualization instantly when user scrubs to different audio position
- **FR-012**: System MUST process files up to 2 minutes in duration
- **FR-013**: System MUST show progress indicator during file processing
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle corrupted files, unsupported formats, processing failures, and network timeouts gracefully with user-friendly error messages
- **FR-015**: System MUST temporarily cache processed files during the session and automatically delete them after 24 hours for privacy and storage management

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **AudioFile**: Represents uploaded audio/video file with metadata (duration, format, processing status)
- **Transcript**: Represents time-stamped Arabic text with word-level timestamps
- **EmotionAnalysis**: Represents emotional state data with timestamps and confidence scores
- **PlaybackState**: Represents current audio position and synchronization data for UI updates
